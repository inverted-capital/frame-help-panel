# starter-widget

This repo demonstrates a minimal setup for building an Artifact widget. It shows
a static help panel that can be embedded inside another application.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Load `dist/index.html` in an `ArtifactFrameHolder` to embed the widget inside
another application.
